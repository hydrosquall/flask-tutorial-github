## Response Codes

Status codes in the 100s are informational messages; you don't need to worry about them most of the time.
Status codes in the 200s mean that the request was processed successfully.
Status codes in the 300s mean that the client must do something else in order to complete the request successfully; an example is a redirect message (301).
Status codes in the 400s mean that the client did something wrong; for example, code 404 means that the resource the client asked for could not be found by the server.
Status codes in the 500s mean that something is wrong with the server; code 500 is a generic error message.
